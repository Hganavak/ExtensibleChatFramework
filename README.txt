This is a simple Java-based chat framework similar in functionality to IRC.

Features:
	- No installation required
	- Server and Clients are configured using only simple text files
	- Threaded client GUI
	- Tabbed chat rooms
	- New rooms can be created dynamically on the client side

Other:
	- This software was made by Sam Kavanagh (hganavak@gmail.com) and Hayden Harrison (hayden.j.harrison@gmail.com) while at the University of Auckland
	- It was design to provide a simple framework whereby students could join a chat room for every subject they were enrolled in
	- Thus, the 'Subjects.txt' file included lists subjects (rooms) a student would automatically join when they run the client
	- This framework is by no means applicable only to universities however, and can easily be modified to suit the users intention
